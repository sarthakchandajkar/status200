# (Optional) Downloading your Notebook and Refreshing your Workspace

This course uses **Coursera Labs** to provide a notebook environment and to grade your work. There might be some instances where you need to download your notebooks or refresh your workspace to start from scratch. This reading item outlines the steps to do so.

## **Downloading your Notebook**

In case you need to download your notebook for troubleshooting or running in your local environment, you can follow these simple steps:

1. From the Menu Bar of the notebook you are working on, click File → Save and Checkpoint to first save your progress.
    
2. Click File → Download as → Notebook (.ipynb). This should start downloading the file into your local machine.
    

## **Refreshing your Workspace**

This will come in handy whenever you need to start from scratch, fetch the latest version of the assignment, or run into a 404 error.

1. Open the notebook from the classroom.
    
2. After the notebook opens up, click File → Open
    
3. When your workspace opens, tick the _check box_ before your notebook file. After it is selected, press Shutdown. The icon beside the filename should turn from green to gray.
    
4. Tick the checkbox again and this time choose Rename and enter any filename other than the original. For example, C1_W1_Assignment.ipynb (original) → C1_W1_Assignment_v2.ipynb
    
5. (Optional) Tick the checkbox of any other file that you want to get a fresh copy of (e.g. dataset files that you might have manipulated irreversibly). Then click Delete . You can also opt to Rename or Download each file individually in case you want to keep them before deleting.
    
6. Click on the Help button on the top right of the page.
    
7. Click the Get latest version button.
    
8. Click the Update Lab button. The page will refresh and you should now see the latest version of the notebook.
