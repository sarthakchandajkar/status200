# Learning Python: Recommended Resources

If you're entirely new to programming, we recommend you complete a beginner-level course in Python before taking this course. While the lectures will focus on the mathematics, **there are labs and assignments throughout the course that will require you are familiar with the following programming concepts:**

- Data types (int, double, bool, string) and data structures (list, dict)
    
- If/else, loops, functions
    
- Importing libraries
    
- Reading, editing, and debugging code, reading documentation
    

**If you're entirely new to programming, here's a couple resources to consider:**

- **A Coursera Course:** Coursera's library includes dozens of Python courses that cover these topics. For example, consider [Google's Crash Course Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course "link to Google's Crash Course Python"), or the [University of Michigan's Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python "University of Michigan's Programming for Everybody Course") followed by their [Python Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data "University of Michigan's Python Data Structures Course") course.
    
- **An Outside Course:** Many outside resources like [Codecademy's Learn Python 3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3 "Codecademy's Learn Python 3 Course") course, [Microsoft's Python for Beginners](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/beginner-python/ "Microsoft's Python for Beginners course") , or [W3 Schools' Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp "W3 Schools' Python tutorial") teach these same introductory concepts.
    
- The web is also filled with other books or video series that teach introductory Python.
    

**If you have experience in another programming language:**

- You probably will be able to learn the Python you need for this course as you go. You may wish to skim a resource like [W3 Schools' Python Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp "W3 Schools' Python tutorial") or the [official Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/ "Python's official documentation") to get familiar with Python syntax. You could also just bookmark those links and refer back to them as necessary.
