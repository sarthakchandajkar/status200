**Definition**: Batch processing involves collecting data over a set period, storing it, and then processing it all at once in "batches" at regular intervals. This approach is ideal when you don't need instant or up-to-the-minute data.

**How It Works**:

- **Data Collection**: Data is collected and stored over time. For example, data could be accumulated throughout the day.
- **Batch Execution**: At the end of a given interval (such as daily, weekly, or hourly), a batch job runs, processing all the accumulated data.
- **Data Availability**: Processed data is typically available after the batch job completes, so there is a delay between data collection and availability.

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Latency**: High latency, as data is processed in bulk after collection.
- **Efficiency**: Efficient for large volumes of data that donâ€™t require immediate results.
- **Cost**: Cost-effective because processing happens less frequently, reducing compute costs.
- **Throughput**: High throughput, as large volumes of data are processed together.

**Examples of Batch Processing Use Cases**:

- **Financial Reporting**: Running daily or monthly reports on transactions.
- **ETL in Data Warehousing**: Loading data into a data warehouse in periodic batches, like overnight or on weekends.
- **Data Analytics**: Analyzing user behavior based on past data (e.g., weekly customer engagement trends).
- **Backups and Archival**: Scheduled data backups or archival for historical analysis.

**Advantages of Batch Processing**:

- **Scalability**: Can handle large data volumes efficiently.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Batch processing can be more economical since it often runs during off-peak hours or at a reduced frequency.
- **Simplicity**: Easier to implement and monitor, especially for periodic data processing.

**Limitations of Batch Processing**:

- **High Latency**: Results are not available in real time, making it unsuitable for applications that require immediate data insights.
- **Resource Intensive**: When dealing with very large data sets, the system might experience high resource usage during batch jobs.
