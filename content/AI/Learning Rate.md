The **Learning Rate** is a critical hyperparameter in [[Machine Learning]] and [[Deep Learning]], controlling the step size of parameter updates during optimization in algorithms like [[Gradient Descent Algorithm]]. It determines how quickly or slowly a model learns by scaling the magnitude of updates to model parameters, such as weights in a [[Neural Network]]. This note explores its role, tuning strategies, and applications, with backlinks to related concepts.

## Definition

In optimization, the learning rate, denoted $\eta$, scales the [[Gradient Vector]] $\nabla J(\theta)$ in the update rule for a [[Cost Function]] $J(\theta)$, where $\theta$ represents model parameters:  
$$  
\theta = \theta - \eta \cdot \nabla J(\theta)  
$$

- $\eta$: Learning rate, typically a small positive value (e.g., $0.01$, $0.001$).
- $\nabla J(\theta)$: [[Gradient Vector]], indicating the direction of steepest increase in the cost function.

A well-chosen $\eta$ balances convergence speed and stability.

> [!NOTE] Intuition  
> Think of the learning rate as the stride length when hiking down a hill (the [[Cost Function]]). Too large, and you overshoot the valley; too small, and you’re stuck dawdling.

## Role in Optimization

The learning rate directly affects how parameters are updated in algorithms like [[Gradient Descent Algorithm]], [[Stochastic Gradient Descent]], or [[Adam Optimizer]]. Its value influences:

- **Convergence Speed**: Larger $\eta$ speeds up updates but risks instability.
- **Stability**: Smaller $\eta$ ensures stable updates but may slow convergence.
- **Accuracy**: Proper $\eta$ helps reach the global or a good local minimum of the [[Cost Function]].

### Real-World Example

In training a [[Convolutional Neural Network]] for image classification (e.g., on ImageNet), a learning rate of $\eta = 0.001$ with [[Adam Optimizer]] often achieves fast convergence while avoiding divergence, enabling the model to accurately classify objects like “dog” or “car.”

## Choosing the Learning Rate

Selecting an optimal $\eta$ depends on the model, dataset, and optimizer. Common strategies include:

1. **Fixed Learning Rate**: Use a constant $\eta$ (e.g., $0.01$). Simple but may not adapt to complex loss landscapes.
2. **Learning Rate Schedules**: Adjust $\eta$ over time:
    - **Step Decay**: Reduce $\eta$ by a factor (e.g., divide by 10 every 10 epochs).
    - **Exponential Decay**: Gradually decrease $\eta$ using $\eta_t = \eta_0 \cdot e^{-kt}$.
    - **Cosine Annealing**: Vary $\eta$ following a cosine function for smooth decay.
3. **Adaptive Methods**: Optimizers like [[Adam Optimizer]] or [[RMSprop]] adjust $\eta$ dynamically based on gradient statistics.

> [!TIP] Practical Tip  
> Start with a small learning rate (e.g., $0.001$ for [[Adam Optimizer]], $0.01$ for [[Stochastic Gradient Descent]]) and monitor the [[Cost Function]] on a validation set. Use a [[Learning Rate Scheduler]] to reduce $\eta$ if the loss plateaus.

### Real-World Example

In fine-tuning [[BERT]] for sentiment analysis on a dataset like SST-2, a small learning rate (e.g., $\eta = 2 \times 10^{-5}$) preserves pre-trained weights while adapting to the task, achieving high accuracy without overfitting.

## Challenges

1. **Too High Learning Rate**: Causes overshooting, leading to divergence or oscillation around the minimum.
    - **Solution**: Reduce $\eta$ or use [[Gradient Clipping]] to limit update size.
2. **Too Low Learning Rate**: Slows convergence, increasing training time.
    - **Solution**: Increase $\eta$ slightly or use adaptive optimizers like [[Adam Optimizer]].
3. **Non-Convex Loss Surfaces**: Common in [[Deep Learning]], where $\eta$ must navigate local minima. Adaptive methods or schedules help.

## Implementation Example

Below is a [[PyTorch]] example of [[Stochastic Gradient Descent]] with a fixed learning rate for linear regression:

```python
import torch

# Sample data: house sizes (X) and prices (y)
X = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], dtype=torch.float32)
y = torch.tensor([2, 4, 5, 4, 5], dtype=torch.float32)
m = torch.tensor(0.0, requires_grad=True)  # Slope
b = torch.tensor(0.0, requires_grad=True)  # Intercept
learning_rate = 0.01
epochs = 1000

# Optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD([m, b], lr=learning_rate)

# Training loop
for _ in range(epochs):
    y_pred = m * X + b  # Forward pass
    loss = ((y_pred - y) ** 2).mean()  # Mean squared error
    optimizer.zero_grad()  # Clear gradients
    loss.backward()  # Compute gradients
    optimizer.step()  # Update parameters

print(f"Slope: {m.item()}, Intercept: {b.item()}")
```

This code uses a fixed learning rate $\eta = 0.01$ to minimize the [[Cost Function]], leveraging [[Backpropagation]].

## Applications

- **Neural Networks**: Tuning weights in [[Convolutional Neural Networks]] or [[Transformers]] for tasks like image recognition or text classification.
- **Linear Regression**: Optimizing coefficients for predictive modeling.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Adjusting policy parameters in environments like game playing.

### Real-World Example

In a fraud detection system, a [[Neural Network]] uses [[Mini-Batch Gradient Descent]] with a learning rate of $\eta = 0.005$ to optimize a binary classification model, identifying fraudulent transactions with high precision.
