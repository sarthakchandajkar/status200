- **Definition**: The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much the model's weights are adjusted with respect to the loss gradient during training. In other words, it determines the size of the steps the optimizer takes to move towards the minimum of the loss function.
- **Key Role**: The learning rate affects how quickly or slowly a model learns:
    - **High Learning Rate**: The model makes large updates to the weights, which can cause it to overshoot the optimal solution, resulting in poor convergence or even divergence.
    - **Low Learning Rate**: The model takes very small steps toward the optimal solution, which can lead to slow convergence or getting stuck in a local minimum.
- **Example**: If you set a learning rate of 0.1 in your polyp detection CNN, the model might take large steps in updating its weights, potentially skipping over the best weights. If you set it too low, say 0.0001, the training process will take much longer, and it might take a long time to see any improvement in performance.
- **Goal**: The goal is to find a balance where the learning rate is small enough to ensure convergence but large enough to avoid unnecessarily long training times.

**Visual**: Imagine youâ€™re trying to descend a hill:

- With a **high learning rate**, you might take big leaps and miss the best spot or overshoot it repeatedly.
- With a **low learning rate**, you take tiny steps, ensuring precision but moving very slowly.
