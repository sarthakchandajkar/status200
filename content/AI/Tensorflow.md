## What is Tensorflow?

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks. It is one of the two most popular deep learning libraries alongside PyTorch.

It was developed by the Google Brain team for Google's internal use in research and production. The initial version was released under the Apache License 2.0 in 2015. Google released an updated version, TensorFlow 2.0, in September 2019.

TensorFlow can be used in a wide variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, C++, and Java, facilitating its use in a range of applications in many sectors.


## What are the key features of Tensorflow?

1. AutoDifferentiation
	- automatically calculating the [[Gradient Vector]] of a model w.r.t. each of its parameters.
	- Useful to algorithms like [[backpropogation]] which require gradients to optimize performance.

1. Eager Execution
	- operations are evaluated immediately as opposed to being added to a computational graph which is executed later
	- 
2.
