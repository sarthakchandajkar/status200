# Potential Questions

### 1. **Why did you choose CNN for classification and U-Net/SegNet for segmentation?**

**Answer:** "I chose CNN for the classification task because CNNs are well-suited for image recognition tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images. For the segmentation stage, U-Net and SegNet were selected because they are specifically designed for biomedical image segmentation. U-Net’s architecture, with its encoder-decoder structure, helps in learning both local and global features, while SegNet uses an efficient upsampling technique to produce accurate segmentation maps. Both models have been widely successful in medical imaging tasks, which is why I felt they were the best fit."

### 2. **What is the Dice Score, and why is it important?**

**Answer:** "The Dice Score is a metric used to evaluate the similarity between two sets of data, in this case, the predicted segmentation and the ground truth. It measures the overlap between the predicted polyp region and the actual polyp region, with a score of 1 indicating perfect overlap. It's particularly important in medical image segmentation because it directly reflects how well the model is capturing the region of interest, which, in this case, is crucial for accurate diagnosis and treatment."

### 3. **How did hyper-parameter tuning improve your model's performance?**

**Answer:** "Hyper-parameter tuning allowed me to fine-tune parameters such as learning rate, batch size, number of filters, and regularization techniques. By adjusting these, I optimized the model’s convergence and avoided overfitting, which led to better segmentation accuracy. For instance, tuning the learning rate helped in finding the right balance between fast convergence and avoiding local minima, while adjusting the batch size improved the generalization ability of the model."

### 4. **What challenges did you face when working with the Kvasir-SEG dataset?**

**Answer:** "One of the main challenges was dealing with the variability in the size, shape, and appearance of polyps in different frames. Some polyps are very small or have unclear boundaries, making segmentation harder. Additionally, there was class imbalance in the dataset, where non-polyp regions vastly outnumbered polyp regions. To address this, I employed techniques like data augmentation and class balancing methods, which helped improve the model’s generalization."

### 5. **Why did you choose Flask for deployment, and how did Azure contribute?**

**Answer:** "Flask is a lightweight, flexible web framework that allowed me to quickly deploy the model and create a front-end that users, like doctors, can interact with to upload colonoscopy footage and receive predictions. I chose Azure because of its scalability, security, and ease of integrating with Flask. Azure also offers services like cloud-based GPUs that can be used for on-demand processing of new data, which ensures that the system is responsive even when handling larger datasets."

### 6. **How does your model handle real-time video footage from colonoscopies?**

**Answer:** "While my current model works frame-by-frame, it can be extended to handle real-time video processing by implementing techniques like frame batching and asynchronous processing to ensure smooth and timely inference. A real-time system would likely need further optimizations such as reducing model size or leveraging real-time inference libraries like TensorRT for faster execution."

### 7. **How do you plan to improve the Dice Score further?**

**Answer:** "To improve the Dice Score, I can explore techniques like using deeper architectures or ensemble methods that combine multiple models for better predictions. Transfer learning from other medical imaging datasets could also enhance the model's feature extraction. Additionally, I plan to fine-tune the model further with advanced regularization techniques such as dropout, and experiment with post-processing techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to refine the segmentation boundaries."

### 8. **Can you explain the difference between U-Net and SegNet? Why use both?**

**Answer:** "Both U-Net and SegNet are encoder-decoder architectures designed for semantic segmentation, but they have key differences

. U-Net is designed with <span style="background:#fdbfff">skip connections</span>, allowing low-level features from the encoder to be directly passed to the decoder, which improves localization. 

SegNet, on the other hand, focuses more on <span style="background:#fdbfff">computational efficiency</span>, using the pooling indices from the encoder to perform non-linear upsampling in the decoder. I used both models to see which provided better results on the dataset, and combining their strengths can often improve accuracy."

### 9. **What are the ethical implications of using AI for medical diagnosis?**

**Answer:** "Using AI in medical diagnosis comes with significant ethical considerations. While AI can greatly enhance diagnostic accuracy, it’s important to remember that models can make mistakes, which might lead to misdiagnosis or missed diagnoses. There’s also the issue of transparency—AI models, especially deep learning ones, can be 'black boxes,' meaning it's hard for doctors to understand why a particular decision was made. Ensuring that the model provides interpretable results and incorporating human oversight into the decision-making process is crucial to mitigate these risks."

### 10. **How did you evaluate the generalization of your model?**

**Answer:** "I evaluated the model’s generalization by using techniques like cross-validation and testing on unseen data from the Kvasir-SEG dataset. I also used data augmentation to expose the model to a wide variety of scenarios, helping it generalize better to unseen images. Lastly, monitoring the performance on validation data during training ensured that the model wasn’t overfitting to the training set."

### 11. **How would you handle cases where the model incorrectly classifies or segments polyps?**

**Answer:** "In cases of misclassification or incorrect segmentation, I would analyze the failure cases to understand if they are due to model limitations or specific outliers in the data. Techniques like adding more data to the training set, particularly in cases where the polyps are difficult to distinguish, could help. I would also consider using ensemble models or attention mechanisms that allow the model to focus on harder-to-classify regions, improving accuracy."

### 12. **What are the computational resources required to train and deploy this model?**

**Answer:** "Training the model required a GPU for faster computation, especially since U-Net and SegNet involve a significant number of parameters. For deployment, the resources depend on whether we aim for real-time processing or batch processing. Flask and Azure offer flexible deployment options, and if the model is served on Azure, it can scale according to demand, using cloud-based GPUs for more intensive tasks when necessary."

By preparing for these questions, you'll demonstrate a deep understanding of your project, not only technically but also in terms of its practical, ethical, and future implications.


### 1. **Features (in Machine Learning and Deep Learning)**

- **Definition**: Features refer to the specific patterns or characteristics extracted from input data, typically an image in computer vision tasks. In a deep learning model like a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), features could be edges, textures, shapes, and more complex patterns as you go deeper into the network.
- **Example**: In the case of polyp detection from colonoscopy footage, features could be things like the texture of the polyp, the color difference between healthy tissue and the polyp, or specific shapes that help identify it.

### 2. **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**

- **Definition**: An encoder-decoder architecture is a <span style="background:#fdbfff">model structure</span> often used in tasks like <span style="background:#fdbfff">image segmentation</span>, where the goal is to learn a mapping from input data (e.g., an image) to output data (e.g., a segmented image). It consists of two main parts:
    - **Encoder**: This part compresses the input into a smaller, abstract representation. In the case of image data, the encoder progressively reduces the spatial dimensions (height and width) while capturing important features, creating a "bottleneck" of essential information.
    - **Decoder**: This part takes the compressed information from the encoder and tries to reconstruct the original input, often expanding it back to the original dimensions. In image segmentation, it reconstructs a segmentation map that shows which pixels belong to which class.
- **Example**: U-Net uses an encoder-decoder structure where the encoder captures the image's features, and the decoder restores the segmentation map, indicating the regions of the image where the polyp is located.

### 3. **Upsampling**

- **Definition**: Upsampling refers to the process of increasing the spatial resolution of an image or feature map, typically after the encoder has compressed it. This process is necessary in the decoder part of the encoder-decoder architecture to bring the data back to its original resolution, pixel by pixel.
- **Example**: In U-Net, after the encoder reduces the image's dimensions (downsampling), the decoder upsamples it back to the original size, allowing the final output to have the same dimensions as the input image but with pixel-wise predictions for segmentation.

### 4. **Segmentation Maps**

- **Definition**: A segmentation map is the output of a semantic segmentation model that assigns a label to each pixel in the input image. It shows the predicted location of specific objects (e.g., a polyp) within the image by marking pixels that belong to that object.
- **Example**: In the case of polyp detection, the segmentation map would indicate the exact location of the polyp in each frame of the colonoscopy footage by assigning a different class (polyp or non-polyp) to every pixel in the image.

### Putting It All Together:

In your project, the CNN extracts **features** from the colonoscopy images (edges, textures, etc.). The **encoder** compresses these features into a smaller, more abstract representation to capture only the most important information. The **decoder** then **upsamples** this compressed representation to create a high-resolution **segmentation map** that indicates which parts of the image contain polyps.
