# What is ADAM?

- Adaptive Moment Estimation.
- Optimization algorithm used in deep learning.
- The main ideas *Momentum* and [[RMSProp]], two robust optimization techniques, combine to make ADAM optimizer.
$$\text{Momentum + RMSProp = ADAM}$$

Think of Adam Optimizer as 

- Optimizers: algorithms that help in tuning weights of the ML model during [[back propogation]].
